1) BASIC

a) "SELECT" and "WHERE" CLAUSE
 select (*) from (table) where (any satisfy conditions)
"*" is for to fetch whole column in table
OR (for single column & muliple column respectively)
Select (any colm) from (table) where (condition)
select (colm1,colm2,colm3) from (table) where (condition)

b)Aggregate funtions for group by and having command
are like -> count,max,min
example: select colm1,colm2,count(colm3)
from (table)
where (any_condition)
group by colm1,colm2
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows
OR
SELECT col1, agregate_fn(col2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY col1
ORDER BY col2

HAVING
We use having clause for giving condition if there is an aggregate function
because where clause cannot be use for aggregate funtion
like
SELECT col1(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY col1(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY col1(s)


3. DISTINCT, COUNT DISTINCT 
for producing useful distinct lists and distinct aggregates

COUNT DISTINCT function returns the (counting number) number 
of unique values in the column or  expression



SQL COUNT DISTINCT
SQL COUNT DISTINCT
Introduction to SQL COUNT DISTINCT

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(col name)) FROM table name

Distinct removes the duplicate rows from the result
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

Strings and time conversions
CONVERT(data_type(length), expression, style)

its conversion of data type
string to int or int to string
example: Select convert(varchar,25.65)

time conversion
Convert an expression from one data type to another (datetime):
SELECT CONVERT(datetime, '2017-08-25');
Convert an expression from one data type to another (varchar):
SELECT CONVERT(varchar, '2017-08-25', 101);

6. UNION and UNION ALL.
UNION:UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more
UNION only returns unique
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2

OR
SELECT column_1, column_2
FROM table_1
[WHERE condition]
 
UNION 
 
SELECT column_1, column_2
FROM table_2
[WHERE condition]

UNION ALL:
UNION ALL returns all records, including duplicates.
SELECT column_1, column_2
FROM table_1
[WHERE condition]
 
UNION ALL
 
SELECT column_1, column_2
FROM table_2
[WHERE condition]


INTERMEDIATE:
1. DML/DDL/DCL concepts

1- DML -> DATA MANiPULATION LANGUAGE
To modify the database objects
Example: INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE

2. DDL -> DATA DEFINITIION LANGUAGE
To create & modify database objects
Example: CREATE,DROP,ALTER,TRUNCATE

3. DCL -> DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE
To give rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system.
Example: REVOKE, GRANT

2.Handling NULLs creatively (e.g. with COALESCE)
The COALESCE function accepts a number of arguments and 
returns the first non-NULL argument.
Example: COALESCE(argument1, argument2,...); 
or>>     SELECT COALESCE(NULL,'Not NULL','OK'); -- return Not NULL


3. Subqueries and the impact of subqueries on efficiency of the query
>A subquery is a query that appears inside another query statement
Example>
SELECT column FROM  table
WHERE  column OPERATOR (
  SELECT column FROM table
);

Subqueries improve query readability as opposed to 
joins by structuring them into isolated parts. 
It is easy to understand and maintain subqueries easily. 
Subqueries can replace complex joins and unions.

4. Temporary tables
Temporary Tables are most likely as Permanent Tables. 
Temporary Tables are Created in TempDB and 
are automatically deleted as soon as the last connection is terminated.

To Create Temporary Table:

CREATE TABLE #EmpDetails (id INT, name VARCHAR(25))  
To Insert Values Into Temporary Table:

INSERT INTO #EmpDetails VALUES (01, 'Lalit'), (02, 'Atharva') 
To Select Values from Temporary Table:

5.Self joins
The SQL Self Join is used to join a table to itself as 
if the table were two tables.
Example
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 a, table1 b
WHERE a.common_field = b.common_field;

6.Window functions like PARTITION, LEAD, LAG, NTILE
You can use LAG or LEAD to create columns that pull values 
from other rowsâ€”all you need to do is enter which 
column to pull from and how many rows away you'd like to do the pull.
LAG pulls from previous rows and LEAD pulls from following rows:

LEAD:
LEAD(return_value, offset [, default])  
OVER (
   [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
   ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC]
)

LAG:
LAG (scalar_expression [,offset] [,default])  
OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause )

NTILE:
NTILE() function assigns a number_expression for every row in a group, 
to which the row belongs

syntax:
NTILE(number_expression) OVER (
   [PARTITION BY partition_expression ]
   ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC]
)

7. UDFs (user defined functions)
8. Use of indexes in querying to make operations faster.
